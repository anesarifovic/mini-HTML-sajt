<h1>Popin coils</h1>

<p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside,<br>
    which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American<br>
    Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T), making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led<br>
     by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was<br>
    immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
